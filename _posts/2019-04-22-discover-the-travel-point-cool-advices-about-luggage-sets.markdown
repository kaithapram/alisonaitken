If you are doubting which luggage set to choose, then Travel Point will advise you how to pick it correctly. Do not hesitate to get in touch with the latest trends and their reviews on Travel Point.

How to choose correctly a luggage? If talking about small suitcases (height up to 59 cm), they are suitable for a short trip for several days. Medium suitcase (height up to 70 cm) - ideal for a trip of one person for 2 weeks or two, but for 7 days. Large suitcases (height 70–80 cm) are a choice for long trips together or even with a small child. Suitcases are two-wheeled and four-wheeled. When you roll a suitcase on two wheels, a quarter of its weight falls on your arm. A bulky suitcase will be hard to carry. Suitcases on four wheels - light and maneuverable: each wheel is fixed on a separate axis and can rotate 360 degrees. But he will be able to drive only on a relatively flat surface: on uneven areas will have to lift it. By the way, remember that you can not lift a loaded suitcase by the pull handle.

One great tip while choosing, pick bright or original colors.
Such a suitcase you quickly notice on the luggage tape, and you do not have to stand around for a long time trying to find your luggage among dozens of similar ones. In addition, you do not grab someone else’s suitcase instead of his. In the cinema, such a story often becomes the beginning of funny adventures, but in real life it’s more likely to bring a lot of worries. For traveling together it is more practical to take two medium suitcases, and not one large
Here are a few advantages of buying two medium-sized suitcases. Each of you will be able to take a sufficient number of things, but you will not have overload.
It is more convenient for everyone to roll their small suitcase than one is rather heavy and voluminous.
Two suitcases are like two personal shelves in the closet: each puts things there to his own taste, without annoying the partner with disorder or, on the contrary, unnecessarily neat arrangement. Yes, and find the right is easier in an individual suitcase than in general.
